To run the tests in this project, you'll first need to deploy a test application to your MarkLogic instance. 

To do so, first download the deployer-4.4.0.jar file from https://github.com/marklogic-community/ml-app-deployer/releases/tag/4.4.0,
which effectively allows you to deploy an app in the same fashion that ml-gradle (https://github.com/marklogic-community/ml-gradle)
does, but without Gradle involved.

Put that jar in the root directory of this project and then run the following command (you should first ensure that 
port 8011 is available in your MarkLogic instance; note that you may have a DHF app server installed already there):

    java -jar deployer-4.4.0.jar -PmlAppName=marklogic-mule-test -PmlRestPort=8011 -PmlConfigPaths=src/test/ml-config -PmlModulePaths=src/test/ml-modules

This currently assumes that admin/admin will work for authentication; this will be improved in the near future. If 
those credentials do not work, you can override them by adding `-PmlUsername=` and `-PmlPassword=` to the arguments
in the call above. 

You should now have a "marklogic-mule-test" app server on port 8011 in your MarkLogic instance. You can then run the
tests via:

    mvn clean test

Instructions on running sonar tests coming soon!
